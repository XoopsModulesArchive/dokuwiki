====== DokuWiki for XOOPS ======
===== DokuWiki =====

[[wiki:DokuWiki]] is a standards compliant, simple to use [[wp>Wiki]], mainly aimed at creating documentation of any kind. It is targeted at developer teams, workgroups and small companies. It has a simple but powerful [[wiki:syntax]] which makes sure the datafiles remain readable outside the Wiki and eases the creation of structured texts. All data is stored in plain text files -- no database is required.

===== XOOPS =====

XOOPS is an extensible, OO (Object Oriented), easy to use dynamic web content management system written in PHP. XOOPS is the ideal tool for developing small to large dynamic community websites, intra company portals, corporate portals, weblogs and much more. 

[[xf>?|DokuWiki for XOOPS]] is a modified DokuWiki compatible with XOOPS module system, aiming at a light, flexible and powerful documentation tool for XOOPS users. The module would be following original DokuWiki's steps except some experiments on Database storage.

===== XOOPS Knowledge Base =====
  * [[xf>wiki|DokuWiki for XOOPS]] is a XOOPS module based on DokuWiki, using [[wiki:syntax|DokuWiki syntax]] and XOOPS ''group permissions''
  * [[xf>wiki|DokuWiki for XOOPS]] is currently using plain text file for data storage. Database storage would be interesting to XOOPS users, which is also our target
  * The [[xf>xoops|XOOPS Knowledge Base]] is intended to be a [[xf>wiki|DokuWiki for XOOPS]] documentation sandbox for XOOPS users, currently underconstruction.
